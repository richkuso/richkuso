# capture_serial_packet Timing Fix - Critical Monitor Improvement

## 🚨 **Critical Issue Identified**

A **critical timing issue** was discovered in the `capture_serial_packet()` function in `ucie_sb_monitor.sv` that could cause **premature gap detection** and **protocol violations**.

---

## 🔍 **Problem Analysis**

### **Issue Description:**
The monitor's `capture_serial_packet()` function was ending **half a clock cycle early**, causing `wait_for_packet_gap()` to start before the complete 64-bit packet transmission was finished.

### **Timing Problem:**
```systemverilog
// PROBLEMATIC FLOW (BEFORE FIX):
1. wait_for_packet_start()    -> @(posedge SBRX_CLK)  // Bit 0 setup
2. capture_serial_packet()    -> 64x @(negedge SBRX_CLK)  // Sample bits 0-63
   // ❌ ISSUE: After 64 negedges, clock is still HIGH for bit 63!
3. wait_for_packet_gap()      -> Starts immediately
   // ❌ WRONG: Clock hasn't gone low yet - gap detection is premature!
```

### **Root Cause:**
- **Negedge sampling**: Correctly samples data on falling clock edges
- **Missing final posedge**: After sampling bit 63 on negedge, the posedge for bit 63 completion was missing
- **Early gap detection**: `wait_for_packet_gap()` started while clock was still high

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Fix Applied:**
Added a **final posedge wait** after the 64-bit sampling loop to ensure complete packet transmission.

```systemverilog
// CORRECTED FLOW (AFTER FIX):
task ucie_sb_monitor::capture_serial_packet(output bit [63:0] packet);
  `uvm_info("MONITOR", "Starting packet capture on negedge SBRX_CLK", UVM_DEBUG)
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 64; i++) begin
    @(negedge vif.SBRX_CLK);  // Sample data on negative edge
    packet[i] = vif.SBRX_DATA;
  end
  
  // ✅ FIX: Wait for final posedge to complete the 64-bit transmission
  // After 64 negedges, we need one more posedge to finish bit 63
  @(posedge vif.SBRX_CLK);
  
  `uvm_info("MONITOR", $sformatf("Packet capture complete: 0x%016h (64-bit transmission finished)", packet), UVM_DEBUG)
endtask
```

### **Timing Correction:**
```
1. wait_for_packet_start()    -> @(posedge SBRX_CLK)     // Bit 0 setup
2. capture_serial_packet():
   - 64x @(negedge SBRX_CLK)  -> Sample bits 0-63       // Data sampling
   - @(posedge SBRX_CLK)      -> Complete bit 63         // ✅ NEW: Final posedge
3. wait_for_packet_gap()      -> Now clock is low        // ✅ CORRECT: Proper timing
```

## 🎯 **Impact and Benefits**

### **Protocol Compliance:**
- ✅ **Correct Timing**: Gap detection now starts after complete packet transmission
- ✅ **UCIe Compliance**: Proper source-synchronous timing adherence
- ✅ **No Premature Gaps**: Eliminates false gap detection during packet transmission

### **Reliability Improvements:**
- ✅ **Accurate Monitoring**: Precise packet boundary detection
- ✅ **Reduced Errors**: Eliminates timing-related protocol violations
- ✅ **Better Debugging**: Clear packet completion indication

### **Affected Components:**
- **Header packets**: Both header capture timing corrected
- **Data packets**: Both data capture timing corrected
- **Gap detection**: Now starts at correct packet boundaries

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Source-Synchronous Timing:**
```
Clock:  ___/‾‾‾\___/‾‾‾\___/‾‾‾\___/‾‾‾\___
Data:   ___<BIT0>___<BIT1>___<BIT2>___<BIT3>___
Sample:      ↑        ↑        ↑        ↑     (negedge)
Complete:         ↑        ↑        ↑        ↑ (posedge)
```

### **64-bit Packet Timing:**
- **Bits 0-63**: Sampled on 64 negedges ✅
- **Bit 63 completion**: Requires final posedge ✅ **ADDED**
- **Gap start**: After final posedge when clock goes low ✅
