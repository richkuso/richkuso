# Interface Assertion Syntax Issues Analysis

## Issues Found in ucie_sb_inf.sv

### 1. **Variable Declaration in Property** ⚠️
**Problem**: Properties declare `realtime` variables inside the property body, which is not valid SystemVerilog syntax.

**Current Code (Lines 57-66):**
```systemverilog
property sbtx_clk_800mhz_frequency;
  realtime current_time, prev_time, time_diff;  // ❌ INVALID
  @(posedge SBTX_CLK) 
    (prev_time = $realtime, 1'b1) |-> 
    @(posedge SBTX_CLK) 
    (current_time = $realtime, time_diff = current_time - prev_time,
     (time_diff >= 1.875ns) || 
     (time_diff >= 1.1875ns && time_diff <= 1.3125ns));
endproperty
```

**Issue**: Variables cannot be declared inside property definitions.

### 2. **Complex Assignment in Assertions** ⚠️
**Problem**: Multiple assignments and calculations within assertion expressions.

**Current Code:**
```systemverilog
(prev_time = $realtime, 1'b1) |-> 
(current_time = $realtime, time_diff = current_time - prev_time, ...)
```

**Issue**: Complex comma-separated assignments may not be supported in all simulators.

### 3. **Time Comparison Syntax** ⚠️
**Problem**: Direct time comparisons with `ns` suffix in properties.

**Current Code:**
```systemverilog
(time_diff >= 1.875ns) || (time_diff >= 1.1875ns && time_diff <= 1.3125ns)
```

**Issue**: Time literal syntax may not be portable across simulators.

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Use Interface Variables for Time Tracking
```systemverilog
interface ucie_sb_inf(input logic clk, input logic reset);
  
  // ... signal declarations ...
  
  // Time tracking variables (interface scope)
  realtime sbtx_prev_time = 0;
  realtime sbrx_prev_time = 0;
  
  // Simplified properties
  property sbtx_clk_800mhz_frequency;
    realtime current_time, time_diff;
    @(posedge SBTX_CLK) 
      (current_time = $realtime, 
       time_diff = current_time - sbtx_prev_time,
       sbtx_prev_time = current_time,
       // Only check frequency for consecutive clocks
       (time_diff >= 1875) || 
       (time_diff >= 1187 && time_diff <= 1312)); // in ps
  endproperty
```

### Fix 2: Separate Time Tracking Logic
```systemverilog
// Use always blocks for time tracking
always @(posedge SBTX_CLK) begin
  sbtx_prev_time <= $realtime;
end

// Simplified property
property sbtx_clk_frequency_check;
  realtime time_diff;
  @(posedge SBTX_CLK) 
    (time_diff = $realtime - sbtx_prev_time,
     (time_diff >= 1875) || 
     (time_diff >= 1187 && time_diff <= 1312));
endproperty
```

### Fix 3: Use Sequence-Based Approach
```systemverilog
// Define sequences for better readability
sequence sbtx_clock_edge;
  @(posedge SBTX_CLK) 1'b1;
endsequence

property sbtx_frequency_check;
  realtime t1, t2;
  sbtx_clock_edge ##0 (t1 = $realtime) ##[1:$] 
  sbtx_clock_edge ##0 (t2 = $realtime, (t2-t1) >= 1187 && (t2-t1) <= 1312);
endproperty
```

## Issues Summary

| Issue | Line | Severity | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Variable Declaration | 58, 69, 82, 93 | High | `realtime` variables declared inside properties |
| Complex Assignments | 60, 62, 84, 86 | Medium | Multiple assignments in assertion expressions |
| Time Literals | 64, 76, 89, 100 | Low | `ns` suffix may not be portable |
| Comma Operators | 62, 73, 86, 97 | Medium | Complex comma expressions in assertions |

## Recommended Solution

Replace the current assertion implementation with a cleaner, more portable version that separates time tracking from assertion logic.
